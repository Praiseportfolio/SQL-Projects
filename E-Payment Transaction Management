In an e-payment company, every withdrawal and payment made using physical devices represents transactions that
include information like transaction ID, Device ID, Agent name, Bank name, amount, transaction status, and card type.
The only way to make meaning out of the numerous information generated regularly is by organising the information in a
way it can be easily retrieved, analysed and interpreted. All these data can be  managed by using a database to keep 
information in tables and identifying them with their key entities. Key entities can be Devices, Banks, and Agents. 
The database used in this project is a financial transactions database used to record daily transactions, and it is done by
Bunny-E-Payment
